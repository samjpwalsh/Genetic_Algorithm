# Genetic Algorithm

- Solution to the 8-queens puzzle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) and generalisation to N-queens using a Genetic Algorithm
- Algorithm explores the search space for solutions by simulating evolution by natural selection
- Hyperparameters (mutation rate and population size) are optimised so the time taken to solve the problem is minimised
- Minimal conflicts heuristic inspired by Heris and Oskoei (2014) is also introduced to avoid missing solutions which are close by in the search space, more information can be found here: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6802550
